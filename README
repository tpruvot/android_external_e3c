See ../README for details on e3

This e3c does support WS key bindings only,
based on e3 version 0.6 . 
(For comparation purposes this file is still included 
as e3.asm_base_for_e3c , former labeled as build #76.)

BTW: it might look like assembler code, 
but in fact e3c is really C code (for gcc).
It was the result of some experiments in
generating C code from asm code by using 
a combination of lex/yacc parser tools.

Another hint: I have got some intersting success stories,
for example linking against dietlibc getting small binaries.

Last but not least:
Thanks to Christian Ostheimer for adaption to mipsel (fritz box fon).
